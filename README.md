# rumba
A Ruby wrapper for the Roomba Serial Command Interface

- - -

In my quest to do everything in Ruby, I was shocked to discover there was no Ruby gem or library for interacting with the iRobot Roomba! *gasp*

Something had to be done. And this is that something.

### Usage

This will get filled out as the library is written :)

### Roadmap
* Add support for all Roomba SCI commands
* Package this into a gem!
* Create an optional DSL

### More Information

The complete Roomba SCI specification can be found [here](http://www.irobot.com/images/consumer/hacker/roomba_sci_spec_manual.pdf)
